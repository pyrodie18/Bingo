This is two small scripts that I made to allow me and abunch of friends to play Bingo during the Greate Plague.  

Bingo.py is a script that generates a Power Point bingo card.  Change the number in line 46 to represent the number of sets of cards you want.  Change the number on line 50 to represent the number of sheets of cards you want (4 cards per sheet).

NumberPicker.py is a script that is used to draw the cards being picked.
